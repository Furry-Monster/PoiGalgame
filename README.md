PoiGalgame is scripted framework to build galgames or adventure games based on Unity.

There are some famous galgame development engine such as `KIRIKIRI`, `NScriptor`, `YU-RIS`, `Siglus&RealLive` and etc. It seems that using Unity engine to galgame developement just like employing a steam engine to crack a nut. But small as the sparrow is, it possesses all its internal organs. To build a excellent galgame with Unity, a great quantity of work should be done.
